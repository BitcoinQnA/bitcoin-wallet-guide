## Breez

[Breez](https://breez.technology/) is a great option for those wanting to get started with Lightning. It seamlessly supports on-chain send/receive via [submarine swaps](https://medium.com/breez-technology/reverse-submarine-swaps-another-step-towards-a-p2p-lightning-economy-bacb040fdca7). Breez solves the inbound liquidity problem by opening channels [on demand](https://medium.com/breez-technology/the-breez-release-candidate-getting-lightning-ready-for-the-global-takeover-b5d1f9756229) for a small fee. Breez also supports LN URL withdrawal and comes with a built in marketplace with Bitrefill.
