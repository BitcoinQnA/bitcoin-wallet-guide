Bitcoin Wallet Guide was built to educate Bitcoiners on the importance of holding their own keys. Our aim is to produce an information hub that provides anyone with enough knowledge to decide which wallet(s) are right for them.

***Not your keys, not your coins.***

We aim to keep this site up to date with the development or additions of new wallets but the Bitcoin industry is a fast moving one, so if you see something incrorrect or missing, please help us out by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/BitcoinQnA/bitcoin-wallet-guide).
