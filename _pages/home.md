title: What is a Bitcoin Wallet?
permalink: /home/
---

A Bitcoin wallet is a just like your real wallet, it's a method of storing value. The main difference with a Bitcoin wallet is that it doesn't actually store bitcoin inside, bitcoins exist solely on the distributed ledger (blockchain). A bitcoin wallet stores the keys required sign the transactions that send bitcoin. When you sign a transaction with your wallet, you show proof that you have the right to spend those coins. This proof can be checked by anyone running a node which stops anyone cheating the system.

There goes a famous saying amongst Bitcoiners, ***'not your keys, not your coins'***. The phrase is aimed to drive home the fact that, if you are not the custodian of your wallet's private keys, you essentially have no bitcoin. A good example of this is buying bitcoin on an exchange and leaving it there. You may have a claim to x amount of bitcoin, but the exchange is actually in control of the private keys. What ***you*** actually have is an IOU that can be taken from you, for various reasons, at any moment. By taking control of your bitcoin in a non custodial wallet, you remove this risk.
